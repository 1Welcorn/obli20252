    The plan should be structured, practical, and directly help the student achieve their goal for the competition.
    Ensure all fields in the JSON schema are populated with high-quality, relevant content.
    The goal in the output JSON should be a refined, single-sentence version of the student's stated goal.

      The exercise prompt was: "${practicePrompt}"

      Do not give feedback on the content or opinion, only on the English language usage.
      
      Example Feedback:
      "Great job trying to use the past tense! One small correction: instead of 'I goed to the store,' we say 'I went to the store.' 'Went' is the irregular past tense of 'go.' Keep up the great work! üëç"
